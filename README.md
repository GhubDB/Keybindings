# Overview

This project is designed to streamline application launching and window switching on both Windows and macOS. The project includes:

- An **AutoHotkey (AHK) script** for Windows, enabling quick application launching, app switching, and window navigation using hotkeys.
- A **forked version of Karabiner-Elements scripts** for macOS, offering the same functionalities as the AHK script.

## Features

### Windows (AutoHotkey Script)

- **Launch Applications**: Quickly open frequently used applications with a single hotkey.
- **Switch Between Applications**: Cycle through running applications.
- **Switch Between Windows**: Move between different windows of the same application.

### macOS (Karabiner-Elements Script)

- **Equivalent Functionality to AHK**: Offers the same app launching and window-switching features as the Windows script.
- **Custom Key Bindings**: Fully customizable key mappings to match user preferences.

## Installation

2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Add a .ini file with the name of your computer.
4. And hotkeys followed by the filepath to the application. Separate the hotkey and the filepath by a comma.
5. Run `PROgramming.ahk` or include it in your startup applications for persistent use.

## Usage
